  I logged in my credential and went to the Azur home page porta as an administrator and entered a default password.
  I went to Resource page and created a virtual machine. I planned to run the virtual machine on the Microsoft edge browswer.

<p>At the end of this lab, I memorized and read the cost of memory and storage usage. I created a Ubuntu virtual machine and selected few options 
in the virtual machine setting.
